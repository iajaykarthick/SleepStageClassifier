# SleepStageClassifier 💤🧠📊

## Introduction 📝
SleepStageClassifier is a machine learning project aimed at classifying sleep stages from polysomnographic (PSG) recordings contained in the sleep-edf database. This project explores various machine learning models, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning techniques, to accurately classify sleep stages based on EEG, EOG, and EMG signals. 

## Project Structure 🏗️
- `data/`: Directory to store the sleep-edf dataset files. 📁
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation. 📓
- `src/`: Source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts. 💻
- `models/`: Trained model files. 🤖
- `requirements.txt`: A list of python package dependencies. 📋
