    "### Intuition Behind Independent Component Analysis (ICA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a powerful computational technique used for separating a multivariate signal into its additive, independent non-Gaussian signals. This method is especially useful in the analysis of EEG (electroencephalogram), EMG (electromyogram), and EOG (electrooculogram) data, where it can be applied to identify and remove artifacts such as eye blinks, cardiac signals, or muscle activity. Below is the intuition behind how ICA achieves this:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Gaussian Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- ICA operates under the assumption that the source signals are **non-Gaussian** and **statistically independent**. Non-Gaussian signals are chosen because Gaussian distributions are fully described by their mean and variance, and a mixture of Gaussian signals would result in another Gaussian distribution, making it difficult to separate the sources. Non-Gaussian signals, on the other hand, provide more information through higher-order statistics, which ICA can exploit to distinguish between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of ICA is to decompose a multivariate signal into components that are statistically independent of each other. Statistical independence means that the information provided by one signal does not affect the information provided by another. This property is key to separating out artifacts from signals like EEG, as these artifacts are often unrelated to the brain activity being measured and can be considered independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Central Limit Theorem plays a significant role in ICA. It states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables tends towards a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the original variables' distribution. In ICA, this implies that while the mixed signals may appear more Gaussian due to the CLT, the original source signals are more non-Gaussian. ICA leverages this by assuming that the observed mixtures are closer to Gaussian distributions and seeks to maximize the non-Gaussianity of the components to find the original sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximizing Non-Gaussianity\n",
    "\n",
    "- ICA involves algorithms that aim to maximize the non-Gaussianity of the output signals. This maximization is typically quantified using statistical measures such as negentropy or kurtosis. \n",
    "- The intuition is that by identifying a transformation that maximizes the non-Gaussian characteristics of the output, ICA can effectively isolate the original, independent source signals from their mixtures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application to EEG/EMG/EOG\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of EEG, EMG, and EOG signals, the sources of interest (e.g., brain activity, muscle activity, eye movements) are mixed within the observed signals. These sources are assumed to be independent (eye movements are not dependent on cognitive task-related brain activity, for instance) and non-Gaussian. By exploiting these properties, ICA can isolate and remove artifacts, leading to cleaner signals for further analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind ICA is centered on its capability to utilize the non-Gaussianity and statistical independence of source signals for effective separation from their mixtures, which is invaluable in biomedical signal processing for artifact removal and signal clarification.\n"
